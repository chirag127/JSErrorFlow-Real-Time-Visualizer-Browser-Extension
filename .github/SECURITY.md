# SECURITY POLICY

## Vulnerability Reporting

We take security seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities within this project, please report the issue via the GitHub Security Advisory or by sending a direct email to the maintainer.

## Reporting Channels

*   **GitHub Security Advisory:** Please use the [Security tab](https://github.com/chirag127/JSErrorFlow-Realtime-DOM-Error-Visualizer-Browser-Extension/security/advisories) to report security vulnerabilities.
*   **Direct Email:** For sensitive issues or if you prefer direct communication, please email `chirag.127@protonmail.com`.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure policy. We will not pursue or will be lenient with legal action against security researchers who act in good faith to find and report vulnerabilities. We ask that you do the same:

1.  **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we have had a reasonable time to fix it.
2.  **Do not exploit the vulnerability** in any way that could harm users or the integrity of the project.
3.  **Provide sufficient information** to reproduce the vulnerability, allowing us to address it effectively.

## Supported Versions

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities in the latest stable version of the browser extension. Older versions may not be actively maintained or patched.

## Response Timeline

*   We aim to acknowledge all valid security reports within **2 business days**.
*   We will provide an estimated timeline for a fix and subsequent release.
*   Once a fix is deployed, we will work with you to coordinate a public disclosure if desired.
